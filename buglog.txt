Checkpoint 1
bug0:
	Mar 7, 2018 - gdt triple faults when entering kernel
	fixed:6e584563 
		Rewrote the LGDT function to give the proper size to the hardware
bug1: 
	Mar 11, 2018 - keyboard doesn't send interrupts
	fixed:54d828a6
		Had to send EOI in IRQ wrapper
bug2:
	Mar 11, 2018 - Interrupt test does not pass
	fixed: 2160e91b 
		Had to edit the tests to account for syscalls entry


Checkpoint 2
bug0:
	Mar 25, 2018 - Experienced occasional page fault when running some filesystem functions
	fixed: a4c9b384 
		Had to add NULL checks to FS functions


Checkpoint 3
bug0: 
	March 30, 2018 - Min heap does not always return correct value
	fixed: e15c424a 
		Had to heapify up all elements, not just one
bug1:
	March 29, 2018 - Found only twenty processes could be run in total on one terminal before page fault
	fixed: 787e63d8
		Needed to properly reset esp0 when halting a process (stack was imbalanced, we would eventually write over the PCB)
bug2:
	April 5, 2018 - Base shells page fault when exiting
	fixed: 270574ea 
		On halt, the esp0 was being set to the bottom of the parent kernel stack, so our execute stack teardown would cross the 8MB boundary
		Instead we now just track the parent processes' esp and use that instead.
bug3:
	April 6, 2018 - RTC open has unexpected behavior - sometimes blocked forever
	fixed: d2600267 
		RTC open was always returning a 0 instead of the generated FD


Checkpoint 4

No major bugs for checkpoint 4
The syscalls getargs and vidmap were implemented without issue
(Many small fixes and checks for checkpoint 3 were found in this time period)

Checkpoint 5
bug0: 
	April 14, 2018 - Pit does not generate interrupts properly
	fixed: 5c658518 
		Had to properly initialize the Frequency of the PIT
bug1:
	April 14, 2018 - Terminal read and write have unexpected behavior with multiple terminals
	fixed: a1ecb02c 
		Had to virtualize terminal properties and fields
bug2: 
	April 15, 2018 - RTC improperly accepts invalid file descriptors
	fixed: b04b783d
		Added bounds checking to RTC functions
bug3:
	April 18, 2018 - RTC Read sometimes blocks forever
	fixed: 4c4ade21
		RTC Read needs to return if the global clock is greater than (not just equal to) the wait time
bug4:
	April 18, 2018 - Terminals sometimes overlap outputs when switching terminals fast
	fixed: 4c4ade21
		Had to add cli/sti when switching terminals
bug5:
	April 19, 2018 - keyboard accepts input after enter if keys pressed very quickly
	fixed: fa18b5c9 
		Fixed by ignoring keypresses if the current terminal is already returned (without finishing terminal_read)
bug6:
	April 28 , 2018 Fish doesn't disappear when switching terminals
	fixed: a877b01c 
		Video memory was not being virtualized between processes correctly. Every terminal gets its own virtual video memory page,
		and we switch this on context switch.
